// Use the "require" directive to load the express module/package
// A "module" is a software component or part of a program that contains one or more routines
// This is used to get the contents of the express package to be used by our application
// It also allows us access to methods and functions that will allow us to easily create a server

const express = require("express");

// Create an application using express
// This creates an express application and stores this in a constant called app
// In layman's terms, app is our server
const app = express();

// For our application server to run, we need a port to listen to
const port = 4000;

// Setup for allowing the server to handle data from requests
// Allows your app to read json data
// Methods used from express JS are middlewares
// Middleware is software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of whatâ€™s offered by the operating system
// API management is one of the common application of middlewares.
app.use(express.json());
// Allows your app to read data from forms
// By default, information received from the url can only be received as a string or an array
// By applying the option of "extended:true" this allows us to receive information in other data types such as an object which we will use throughout our application

// Express has methods corresponding to each HTTP method
// This route expects to receive a GET request at the base URI "/"
// The full base URI for our local application for this route will be at "http://localhost:3000"
